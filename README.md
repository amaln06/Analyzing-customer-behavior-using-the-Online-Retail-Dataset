# Analyzing customer-behavior using the Online-Retail Dataset
# Description
This task involves analyzing customer behavior using the Online Retail Dataset (UCI) through RFM Analysis, which evaluates:
•	Recency – How recently a customer made a purchase
•	Frequency – How often they made purchases
•	Monetary – How much money they spent

Each customer is scored on these three metrics (1 to 5), and then grouped into meaningful segments like Champions, Loyal Customers, and At Risk. These segments help businesses design targeted marketing strategies, such as offering discounts to loyal buyers or re-engagement emails to inactive ones.

# Result: 
The output of the RFM analysis provides a detailed overview of customer purchasing behavior by calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer. Based on these values, customers are assigned individual RFM scores (ranging from 1 to 5 for each metric), which are then combined into an overall RFM segment and score. These scores are used to categorize customers into meaningful groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, and At Risk. The output includes a table listing each customer’s metrics and segment, along with a graph that visually represents the number of customers in each segment. This segmentation allows businesses to easily identify and understand their most valuable customers, as well as those who may need re-engagement, enabling targeted and effective marketing strategies.
